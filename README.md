ProjectEuler
============

From the ProjectEuler.net web site: 
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

This repo contains all solutions I've built thus far. You'll note that there are currently (as of July 2013) over 400 Euler problems. I've got a long way to go.
